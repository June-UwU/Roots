## Roots Interpreter 
Roots is my initial attempt in creating a interpreter, this is an explorative process with lots of code rewrite expectations in the future and is considered to be done once a good implementation of interpreter is done.

| Roots Error Handler      | There is an impl of a initial error handler which is under used. | To be a module used throughout roots to report error both runtime and parsing    |
| Roots Error Synchronizer | No Impl at the moment                                            | To be a module that works with error handler to synchronize the potential errors |
